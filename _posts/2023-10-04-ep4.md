title: Ep 4. Recent Advances in Quantum Technologies
description: Quantum technologies have moved from science fiction to reality, opening up new possibilities in various fields. Thankfully, you don't need to be a quantum physicist to understand quantum technologies. All you need to know is that quantum technologies are tools and techniques that take advantage of the weird and wonderful rules of quantum physics to do something useful.

## Quantum Computing
Quantum computers utilize quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once due to quantum superposition, thereby potentially processing a higher volume of information more efficiently. 

**IBM** offers cloud-based quantum computing services through their Q Experience platform, which allows researchers to run algorithms on their quantum processors which are up to 433 qubits (IBM Osprey) [1]. In 2019, **Google** announced their quantum processor Sycamore with 53 qubits had achieved "quantum supremacy" by sampling random circuits and solving a problem in 200 seconds that would take the most powerful supercomputer thousands of years [2]. Several other companies like **IonQ**, **QuEra**, and **Xanadu** are developing quantum processors with 32, 256, and 216 qubits, respectively [3]. While full scale quantum computers capable of practical applications are still years away, these advancements demonstrate potentials in *drug discovery*, *logistics*, *network optimization* and *machine learning*.

## Quantum Sensors
Quantum sensors exploit quantum coherence to enhance sensor capabilities. The UK **University of Birmingham**'s quantum gravity gradiometer, for instance, uses quantum interference for precise measurement of tiny variations in gravitational fields [4]. This has applications in mineral and oil exploration, underground infrastructure mapping, and aquifers mapping.

In Jan 2021, US Army scientists develop Ultra-broadband quantum receiver the first to analyze entire radio frequency spectrum from 0 up to 20 GHZ, detect AM, FM, Bluetooth and WiFi [5].

## Quantum Communications and Networking
Quantum communication leverages quantum entanglement for highly secure information transfer. An excellent example is China's **Micius** satellite sucessfully distributing quantum keys to ground stations near Vienna and Beijing, enabling a secure virtual meeting which are 7400 km apart [6].

In addition to the Micius success, other notable quantum communication networks include a land-based quantum key distribution link set up between Vienna and St Poelten, Austria using 200 km of standard fibre optic cable [7], as well as US DARPA quantum network [8].
