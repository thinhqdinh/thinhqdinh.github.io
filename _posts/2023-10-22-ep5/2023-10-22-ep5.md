title: Ep 5. Understanding Top 7 Basic Quantum Operations with Visualization
description: Quantum computing utilizes quantum bits or qubits which can represent a superposition of 0 and 1. This allows qubits to perform computations on all possible states simultaneously. However, this behavior can be counterintuitive when compared to classical binary bits. Visualizing how quantum operations manipulate qubit states can help build an intuition for how quantum algorithms work. In this post, we will look at top 7 common single-qubit quantum gates and how they transform qubit states on the Bloch sphere.

## The Bloch Sphere
The state of a single qubit can be represented as a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. The poles correspond to the |0> and |1> states. All other points represent superpositions of |0> and |1> defined by two angles - $\theta$ and $\phi$ in spherical coordinate $[r, \theta, \phi]$

### Visualize the |0> state


```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_vector

# You can use spherical coordinates instead of cartesian.

plot_bloch_vector([1, 0, 0], coord_type='spherical')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_4_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>


### Visualize the |1> state


```python
plot_bloch_vector([1, np.pi, 0], coord_type='spherical')
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_6_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
 



## Pauli X (NOT) gate


The Pauli X gate, also known as the NOT gate, performs a bit flip, transforming $\|0>$ to $\|1>$ and vice versa. On the Bloch sphere, it corresponds to a 180° rotation about the x-axis.


```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.x(0)
qc.draw('mpl')

```


 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_8_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>




```python
from qiskit.visualization import visualize_transition
visualize_transition(qc, trace = True,saveas = "x_gate.gif", fpg = 20, spg = 2)
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/x_gate.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

## Pauli Y Gate

The Pauli Y gate performs a bit and phase flip. It rotates the qubit state by 180° about the y-axis.


```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.y(0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_12_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>


```python
visualize_transition(qc, trace = True,saveas = "y_gate.gif", fpg = 20, spg = 2)
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/y_gate.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

## Pauli Z Gate

The Pauli Z corresponds to a 180° rotation about the z-axis.



```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.h(0)
qc.z(0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_15_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>



```python
visualize_transition(qc, trace = True,saveas = "z_gate.gif", fpg = 20, spg = 2)
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/z_gate.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

## Hadamard Gate
The Hadamard Gate is a fundamental element in quantum computing that applies a uniform **superposition** of states to a qubit. Unlike the Pauli gates, which rotate around one of the major axes, x, y, and z, the Hadamard gate rotates our quantum state by pi radians or 180 degrees around the Bloch sphere vector [1 0 1] which is the vector pointing halfway between the x-axis and the z-axis


```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.h(0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```


 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_18_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
 



### Visualize the axis of H rotation


```python
plot_bloch_vector([1, np.pi/4, 0], coord_type='spherical')
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_20_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>




```python
visualize_transition(qc, trace = True,saveas = "h_gate.gif", fpg = 20, spg = 3)
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/h_gate.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
Hence, applying two consecutive H operations, we go back to the original position


```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.h(0)
qc.h(0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_23_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>




```python
visualize_transition(qc, trace = True,saveas = "2h_gate.gif", fpg = 20, spg = 3)
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/2h_gate.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

## RX, RY, RZ gates

These perform arbitrary single-qubit rotations about the X, Y and Z axes. The rotation angle is specified as a parameter.

### Single RX gate
Here is an example of 90° rotation about X axis.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.rx(np.pi/2,0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_27_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>




```python
visualize_transition(qc, trace = True,saveas = "rx_gate.gif", fpg = 20, spg = 3)
```

 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/rx_gate.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

### Sequence of RX, RY, RZ gates
Here is an example of 90° rotation about X axis, then 90° rotation about Z axis, then 90° rotation about Y axis

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.rx(np.pi/2,0)
qc.rz(np.pi/2,0)
qc.ry(np.pi/2,0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```


 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/ep5_30_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
 




```python
visualize_transition(qc, trace = True,saveas = "3r_gates.gif", fpg = 20, spg = 3)
```


 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep5/3r_gates.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
