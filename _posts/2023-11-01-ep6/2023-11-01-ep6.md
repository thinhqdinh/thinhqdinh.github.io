## Quantum Entanglement - Connecting Quantum States

Quantum entanglement is a peculiar phenomenon that connects the quantum states of particles, regardless of their distance from each other. When particles become entangled, measuring one will instantaneously affect the other, even if they are light-years apart. This bizarre behavior, coined by Einstein as "spooky action at a distance," challenges our classical understanding of physics.

Now we will setup a quantum connect by generate an entangled pair of qubits. First, we need to initalize a circuit of two qubits.


```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, execute, BasicAer, IBMQ
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram, plot_bloch_multivector,plot_bloch_vector
from qiskit import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
```


```python
alice = QuantumRegister(1, name='Alice')
bob = QuantumRegister(1, name='Bob')

qc = QuantumCircuit(alice,bob)
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_4_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



Then, we apply H gate and CNOT gate to make an entangled pair.


```python
qc.h(alice[0])
qc.cx(alice[0],bob[0])
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_6_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    
    



Don't forget to add classical registers to store the measurement of these two qubits.


```python
alice_classical_reg = ClassicalRegister(1,'Alice_class_reg')
bob_classical_reg = ClassicalRegister(1,'Bob_class_reg')

qc.add_register(alice_classical_reg)
qc.add_register(bob_classical_reg)
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_8_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



Now, we can measure the values of these qubits


```python
qc.measure(alice[0],alice_classical_reg)
qc.measure(bob[0],bob_classical_reg)
qc.draw('mpl')
```


 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_10_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

    



Due to quantum entanglement effect, we can see that these two qubits end up with $\|00>$ or $\|11>$ with 50-50 possibility.


```python
backend = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
res = execute(qc, backend,shots =2000).result()
plot_histogram( res.get_counts())
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_12_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

    



## Quantum Teleportation

Building upon the concept of entanglement, we have quantum teleportation. Quantum teleportation is a process that enables the transfer of a quantum state from one location to another, without the qubit itself moving through the intervening space. This phenomenon relies on the curious logic of quantum mechanics and has powerful implications for quantum communication. 

### Understanding Quantum Teleportation

The goal of quantum teleportation is to reliably transport an unknown quantum state from one place to another. It utilizes a pair of entangled qubits and classical communication to achieve this feat.

The basic steps involved are:

1. A pair of entangled qubits (1 and 2) is generated and qubit 2 is given to a recipient Bob. 

2. The sender Alice has some unknown qubit (qubit 0) that she wants to teleport to Bob.

3. Alice performs a joint measurement on qubit 0 and qubit 1, which collapses their states based on the rules of quantum mechanics. 

4. Alice sends the classical measurement results to Bob through a regular communication channel.

5. Depending on the message from Alice, Bob performs appropriate gate operations on qubit 2 to reconstruct the state of qubit 3.

Voila! The unknown quantum state has been teleported from Alice to Bob.

### Simulating Quantum Teleportation with PennyLane

#### Step 0: First, we need to initialize the system with 3 qubits and 2 classical registers


```python
target_info = QuantumRegister(1, name='target_info')
alice = QuantumRegister(1, name='Alice')
bob = QuantumRegister(1, name='Bob')

qc = QuantumCircuit(target_info,alice,bob)
alice_classical_reg = ClassicalRegister(1,'Alice_class_reg')
bob_classical_reg = ClassicalRegister(1,'Bob_class_reg')

qc.add_register(alice_classical_reg)
qc.add_register(bob_classical_reg)
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_14_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



#### Step 1: Then, we create a pair of entangled qubits. 
One is hold by Alice, another is hold by Bob


```python
qc.h(alice[0])
qc.cx(alice[0],bob[0])
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_16_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



#### Step 2: After that, at the sender side, we prepare a quantum state that we want to send to Bob. 
For example, here we have state to send


```python
plot_bloch_vector([1, np.pi/4, -np.pi/2], coord_type='spherical')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_18_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    




```python
qc.barrier()
qc.rx(np.pi/4,0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```


 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_19_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



#### Step 3: Next, Alice applies targeted quantum state to her qubit


```python
qc.barrier()
qc.cx(target_info[0],alice[0])
qc.h(target_info[0])
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_21_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



#### Step 4 : Alice measures state of qubits, stores results in classical bits and sends it to Bob


```python
qc.barrier()
qc.measure(target_info[0],alice_classical_reg)
qc.measure(alice[0],bob_classical_reg)
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_23_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



#### Step 5 : Bob Decodes based on bits he receives


```python
qc.z(bob[0]).c_if(alice_classical_reg, 1)  #if alice_classical_reg is 1 apply Z gate
qc.x(bob[0]).c_if(bob_classical_reg, 1) #if bob_classical_reg is 1 apply x gate, look at table above
qc.draw('mpl')
```



 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_25_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    




```python
backend = BasicAer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
out_vector = execute(qc, backend).result().get_statevector()
plot_bloch_multivector(out_vector)
```


 <div class="row mt-3">

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ep6/2023-11-01-ep6_26_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
    



Then, the state is successfully sent to Bob
